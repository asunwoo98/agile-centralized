[19 Tips for Software Engineers in 2019](https://dev.to/emmawedekind/19-tips-for-software-engineers-in-2019-4okm)

### What I found interesting

The biggest surprise for me when I read this article is that most of the 19 tips the author had for software engineers were fairly general advice. Many of the tips and mindsets can be applicable to a variety of other fields. It seems like the emphasis of the article is to keep a healthy mentality and postive mindset, and start with the basics to build a solid foundation. It is also important to stay motivated and work zealously where you can. 

On the other hand, there were some tips that is specific to software engineering, such as getting involved in open source and learn to decipher code. While they fall under the category of some general advice, they are helpful examples that prospective software engineers could follow.
